Overview     
DSA Visualizer is a command-line project in C++ that helps visualize common Data Structures and Algorithms step by step.
Itâ€™s designed as an interactive learning tool to understand sorting, searching, and graph algorithms.     

Features    
Sorting Algorithms       
1.Bubble Sort (step by step)     
2.Insertion Sort     
3.Selection Sort      

Searching Algorithms     
1.Linear Search     
2.Binary Search (with sorted array)     

Graph Algorithms     
1.BFS (Breadth First Search)     
2.DFS (Depth First Search)
